üöÄ Thrilled to share my recent project: Real-Time Dance Pose Detection using Python & MediaPipe!

As part of my journey into computer vision and AI, I developed a system that processes live webcam feed to detect and track key body landmarks ‚Äî representing human poses ‚Äî and visualizes only these movements using colored skeletal lines on a clean, black full-screen background.

üîç What makes this project special?
Real-Time Processing: Captures and analyzes pose data from live video without noticeable lag.

Minimalistic Visualization: Instead of showing raw video, the app displays just the essential body joints and connections, giving a clear, distraction-free view of movement.

Full-Screen Display: Offers immersive visualization suitable for dance training, fitness coaching, or motion analysis.

Accurate Pose Estimation: Leveraging MediaPipe‚Äôs powerful pose detection model to identify over 30 key body landmarks with high confidence.

Customization Potential: Easily adaptable for applications like rehabilitation exercises, sports training, or interactive art installations.

üß† What I learned?
Gained hands-on experience with MediaPipe, OpenCV, and real-time video processing techniques.

Improved skills in pose estimation algorithms and visualization methods.

Enhanced understanding of how to create minimalistic, user-focused visual outputs from complex sensor data.

üéØ Why it matters?
Pose detection technology has immense applications from health and fitness to entertainment and accessibility. This project gave me a practical glimpse into how such systems can be designed efficiently, paving the way for more advanced AI-powered motion analysis solutions.

Would love to connect with fellow developers, AI enthusiasts, and professionals who share an interest in computer vision and motion capture!
